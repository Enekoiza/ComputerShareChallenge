# Computer Share C# coding challenge

This project is based in a self-selected project to complete a challenge requested by a renamed company called Computer Share.

The project works around the idea of morse encoding and decoding.

The idea is, given certain messages transform the message into its opposite.

The code has been developed using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

The project emulates the MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach.

To encode and decode the messages we use the data structure called Binary Tree, which creates a tree with nodes that expand into 2 children each time.


And example of the binary tree can be found in this [link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Morse-code-tree.svg).

Once the program is running you will be ask for a command, then after entering the message the result will be shown.

Finally, to create the decoding and encoding function, first some test were written and they can be found in the solution as well.
